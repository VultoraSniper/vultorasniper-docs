## 6. Security & Access Control

At VultoraSniper, protecting your assets and data is our highest priority. We’ve implemented multiple layers of security to ensure your trading remains both safe and seamless:

* **One-Time Access Codes**: Secure initial signup with unique, one-time use codes sent via email after purchase—eliminating unauthorized access.
* **Robust User Verification**: Every user must verify their identity before accessing trading or group monitoring features.
* **Encrypted Session Management**: Sessions use secure tokens with automatic expiry after 24 hours of inactivity, preventing stale access.
* **On-Chain Transaction Verification**: All buy/sell operations are confirmed on the Solana blockchain before reporting—ensuring transparency and preventing failed swaps.
* **Controlled Data Storage**: While API credentials and private keys reside securely in our database, server-level protections and restricted access policies keep them confidential.
* **Error & Abuse Safeguards**: Built-in slippage guards and real-time error notifications protect you against front-running, invalid orders, and unexpected failures.

**Coming Soon:**

* **API Credential Encryption**: Storing your credentials with advanced encryption algorithms.
* **Regular Security Audits**: Ongoing third-party reviews to continuously harden our systems.
* **Enhanced Access Controls**: Granular permissions for advanced user roles and bot operations.

Your peace of mind matters. With VultoraSniper’s comprehensive security suite, you can trade confidently, knowing your funds and information are in safe hands.

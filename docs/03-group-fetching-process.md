### 3.2 Advanced Group Fetching

When a user has enabled Advanced Fetching (valid session file present), the flow is:

1. **Automatic Group Discovery**  
   - Bot retrieves all groups the user belongs to.  
   - Displays a numbered list of groups.  

2. **Group Selection**  
   - User enters the number of the group they want to track.  
   - Groups are added to tracking immediately.  

3. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   - Listens to Telegram API streams for new messages.  
   - Parses text and extracts images for contract addresses.  

4. **Validation**  
   - Confirms each address before alerting.  
   - Filters duplicates.  

5. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   - Notifies user via bot messages.

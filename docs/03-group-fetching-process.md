üìö Learn more about this feature in our documentation.
```

Buttons: ‚úÖ **Yes, Proceed** | ‚ùå **No, Skip**

* Tap **Yes, Proceed** to continue.

**Step 3: Obtain Your Telegram API Credentials**
To fetch groups directly from Telegram, you need an **API ID** and **API Hash**:

1. Open your browser and go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
2. Log in with the same phone number you use for this bot.
3. Click **API Development Tools**.
4. Under **Create new application**, fill in any name (e.g., ‚ÄúVultoraSniper‚Äù), a short description, and your URL (optional).
5. After creating, you‚Äôll see **App api\_id** and **App api\_hash**.
6. Copy both values.

The bot then prompts:

```
Please send your credentials in the format:
API_ID:API_HASH
Example: 123456:abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

* Send this line; the bot replies: `‚úÖ API credentials saved! Now enter your phone number...`

**Step 4: Provide Phone Number**
Bot asks:

```
Enter your phone number (with +countrycode, no spaces), e.g. +12345678901
```

* Send your number.
* Bot replies: `‚úÖ Phone number received! A verification code has been sent via Telegram.`

**Step 5: Enter Verification Code**
Bot asks:

```
Please enter the 5-digit code with spaces between each digit.
Example: 1 2 3 4 5
```

* Send code like `1 2 3 4 5`.
* Bot confirms: `‚úÖ Successfully logged in! You can now use advanced group fetching.`

**Step 6: Select Groups**
The bot retrieves your groups and shows:

```
üìÇ Select a group to track

1. @group1 (Trading Alerts)
2. @project_news (Announcements)
3. @memeslaundry (Fun)
...

üí¨ Now enter the group number you'd like to track.
üîô Cancel
```

* Send the number (e.g. `2`) to add that group.
* Bot replies: `‚úÖ Group @project_news added and is now being tracked.`
* To add more, send another number; when finished, tap `üîô Cancel` or type `/settings`.

Once groups are selected, the bot begins continuous monitoring and real-time contract detection.

### 3.3 Manual Group Fetching

1. **Open Group Management**

   * Send `/groups manage`.
2. **Add Group**

   * Bot prompts to forward a message, send group @username, or invite link.
3. **Bot Validation**

   * Validates the group and replies `‚úÖ Group <identifier> added.`
4. **Repeat or Exit**

   * Forward another message or send another identifier to add more, or type `/back` to finish.
